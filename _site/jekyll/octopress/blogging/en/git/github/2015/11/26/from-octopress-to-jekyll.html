    <h1 class="post-title">From Octopress to Jekyll!</h1>
    <p class="post-meta">Nov 26, 2015</p>
  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
    <p><a href="https://github.com/embs/embs-blog.github.io/commit/e2bc5b28d6e2d6059f1d9db4b8d39dfba9190797">Several months ago</a> I was pretty amazed with the ability of
blogging through a static pages generator that was open source and had a nice
name: Octopress. Some time later I am still quite delighted with another
analogous tool that is also open source but has a less fancy name: Jekyll.</p>

<p>Jekyll is the foundation for Octopress and what made me change to it at first
was that <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/">GitHub encourages it</a>. Such encouragement comes along
with the promise of painless integration with GitHub pages.</p>

<p>I’ve took an while without updating the Octopress blog and get back to the labor
seemed pretty tough – since I wanted to spend no time with configuration nor
stuff like that. After acknowledging GitHub inclination to Jekyll I’ve also read
<a href="https://lauris.github.io/blogging/2014/08/16/jekyll-vs-octopress/">a blog post comparing the two blogging tools</a> and
<a href="http://octopress.org/2015/01/15/octopress-3.0-is-coming/">this entry in the Octopress blog</a> which is not that comforting.</p>

<p>So the choice was made. Time to move on and get the life going on again.</p>

<h1 id="moving-out">Moving out</h1>

<p>First thing was following up the step-by-step guide for deploying Jekyll with
GitHub pages provided by GitHub. Easy peasy.</p>

<p>It was sad to verify that my CNAME configuration messed with the CSS, which had
to be also statically provided. <a href="https://github.com/embs/blog/commit/3e141990f4ae1ba63683830e2446b8ef99ca9409">Configuring the Jekyll options</a>
did the trick and style rules were finally working. I’ve had already suffered
a lot with that on Octopress and this suffering probably done my life easier nowadays.</p>

<p>Next thing was to import the old posts from the former Octopress blog. I was
annoyed by the fact that I couldn’t find the markdown files anymore. The only thing
that occurred to me was that GitHub neglected the posts since they lived in a
folder named <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code>. (I’ve imaginatively created this rule of GitHub behavior)</p>

<p>After coming and going around a lot and trying an <a href="https://domchristie.github.io/to-markdown/">HTML to Markdown</a>
tool, I’ve finally rediscovered that there was a branch named <code class="highlighter-rouge">source</code> in the
Octopress repository – and all the markdown stuff was still there!</p>

<p>Since I’ve used the same git repository to introduce the new Jekyll blog, the
rediscovering made me seek for and <a href="http://nicolasgallagher.com/git-checkout-specific-files-from-another-branch/">find</a> one awesome git feature that
I wasn’t aware of: checkout files from a different branch.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ git checkout source -- source/_posts
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And my posts were mine again!</p>

<h1 id="moreover">Moreover</h1>

<p>Another thing that impressed me is how seamlessly is the generation of HTML from
the markdown files. That is probably accomplished by the <a href="https://github.com/embs/blog/commit/f496d33372a5ef0f5a9c10add69b2894f825c4d5#diff-8b7db4d5cc4b8f6dc8feb7030baa2478R3">github-pages gem</a>
but I haven’t dived deep on it yet. Maybe another time.</p>
